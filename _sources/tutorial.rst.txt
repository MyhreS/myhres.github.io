The main point of this package is to with minimal effor view, process and augment images.
It consists of 3 main packages:

* quickview: a package to quickly view images when in need of checking them.
* preprocess: a package to preprocess images if they are not in the correct format.
* augment: a package to augment images.

In all of these packages you initialize their classes to access their neat functions. These explain how to use them individually:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 4

   quickview
   preprocess
   augment
